# Clout gang's arduino assignment

## No sauce, no paper, no clout, juice


### Log 1: Week 3

We've finished the first project as we built the board and got the code in week 1 but it still wasn't working. In week 2 we figured out the problem that we didn't have one of the wires attached to ground, after fixing this it started working as when we clicked the button the light turned off and when you released it would turn back on. We then went into the code and changed it so that when you click the button the light would turn on and when you released it would turn off.  

#### Update Week 3

We updated our circuit board to accommodate two lights, the first light came on but the second one only came on really faintly. We believe this was because the circuit board was either too long or that the resistor was too strong.

### Week 4

This week we added a delay in milliseconds, we've posted this code in the repository. We also were able to print the time on the serial moniter so you could see it as it was running. We also found that in our program the longer the delay the longer you have to press the button to make the light turn on. For example, a 100ms delay would require only a short button press for the light to come on, whereas a 1000ms delay would require a bit of a hold.
